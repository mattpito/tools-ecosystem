# ELIXIR Tools Ecosystem
This is the main branch for the github repo hosting the Tools Ecosytem digital presence. The Tools Ecosystem is an initiative suppored by the European Ifrustucre for Life Sciences (ELIXIR) and aims to aggregate, sync and redistribute  metadata generated from nuemrous services in bioinfromatic research and beyond.
## Services Connected to the Tools Ecosystem
Many European and Global services are linked to the Tools Ecosystem central hub such as Galaxy, bio.tools, OpenEbench, WorkflowHub, BioContainers and BioConda.
## The purpose of the Tools Ecosystem
We want to help researchers to be able to find, test, deploy and run bioinformatic software (and beyond) by providing compehensive links to each service.
## Metadata are evolving and so is the Tools Ecosystem.
Metadata for bioinformatic software include numerous attributes e.g., licencing, citations, dependencies, installation,  perfomance benchmarking and so forth. These are just a few examples and with the abundance of the different metadata it becomes complicated for the user to have access to all the information. The Tools Ecosystem is aiming to connect to more and more services and drive Open Science forward. For example we aimt to include training materials and training metadata as well.
